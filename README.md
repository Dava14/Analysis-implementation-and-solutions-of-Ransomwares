Functional Ransomware programmed in python and a Ransomware detector based on files modifications. Bachelor thesis with a grade of 9.7 over 10

# Abstract
In this work, a crypto-ransomware prototype will be developed with basic functionalities that will cipher the files of a computer to obtain economic revenue. This ransomware will be tested in order to see the impact that it can reach if the user does not take any basic preventive measures. Next, a ransomware detector will be implemented whose purpose will be find out if one is being executed, terminate its activity and delete the executable file associated. The detector will attend to the modifications files per second speed of the computer and, for doing it, two core concepts associated with the adjustment of the detector will come into play: the batch and the detection band. Finally, the detector will be tested to draw some conclusions and possible future improvements.
